# Charlie G. Barker, Ph.D.

I am a **bioinformatician** and **computational biologist** with a Ph.D. from **EMBL-EBI/University of Cambridge**, specializing in multi-omics data integration, network modeling, and mechanistic analysis of cellular signaling. I am currently a **Research Fellow** at **University College London (UCL)**, where my research focuses on developing computational models to explore the interaction between mutations and signaling pathways in **cancer progression**. My goal is to identify personalized therapeutic strategies to improve cancer treatment outcomes.

## Research Expertise

- **Computational Modeling**: I develop network-based and mechanistic models to understand cellular processes, integrating data from transcriptomics, proteomics, and genomics.
- **Structural Biology**: I apply advanced homology modeling and AI-driven approaches for predicting and analyzing antibody structures.
- **Multi-Omics Analysis**: I integrate diverse datasets, including NGS, RPPA, and mass spectrometry, to derive actionable insights into biological mechanisms.
- **Programming & Tool Development**: Proficient in **R**, **Python**, **Bash**, and **Perl**, I have developed several tools, including **volcanoPlus** for statistical visualization and **biotubemapR** for exploring biological networks.
- **Genomics & Proteomics**: Skilled in analyzing SNPs, CNVs, phosphoproteomics, and clinical datasets from sources like **CPTAC** and **TCGA**.
