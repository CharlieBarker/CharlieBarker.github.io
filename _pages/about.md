# Charlie G. Barker, Ph.D.

I am a **bioinformatician** and **computational biologist** with a Ph.D. from **EMBL-EBI/University of Cambridge**, specializing in multi-omics data integration, network modeling, and mechanistic analysis of cellular signaling. I am currently a **Research Fellow** at **University College London (UCL)**, where my research focuses on developing computational models to explore the interaction between mutations and signaling pathways in **cancer progression**. My goal is to identify personalized therapeutic strategies to improve cancer treatment outcomes.
